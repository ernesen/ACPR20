# The tasks in this include_task detect whether the configuration is 
# an all-in-one (AIO) confifuration, i.e., a configuration with a single 
# host, call it aio_host_name, that is common to the three groups:
#
#  cust_master_hosts:
#  - { fqdn: <aio_host_name> }
#
#  cust_infra_hosts:
#  - { fqdn: <aio_host_name> }
#
#  cust_worker_hosts:
#  - { fqdn: <aio_host_name> }
#
#
# The configuration is AIO if both these conditions are met:
#
#  1. each of the groups above contains one host
#
#      len(cust_master_hosts) == len(cust_worker_hosts) == len(cust_infra_hosts) == 1
#
#
#  2. the host name is the same in all three groups:
#
#      ( cust_master_hosts[0].fqdn == cust_worker_hosts[0].fqdn ) and 
#      ( cust_master_hosts[0].fqdn == cust_infra_hosts[0].fqdn )
