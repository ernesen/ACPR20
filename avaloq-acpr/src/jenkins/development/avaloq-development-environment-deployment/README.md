# Avaloq Development Environment Jenkins pipeline

Provides an integrated Jenkins pipeline to prepare an Oracle database using *Avaloq Database Automation and Integration (ADAI)* and deploy a constellation of containerized applications on top using the *Avaloq Installator*. 

This pipeline is meant to set up development and test environments. Installation and configuration is similar to the *Avaloq Constellation Deployment Pipeline*, please see its [README](../../avaloq-constellation-deployment/README.md).
